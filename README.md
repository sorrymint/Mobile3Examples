# Mobile 3 Examples

This repo holds all in class examples. Each Unit has a few days worth of examples.

## Running Projects

To run a project locally you will need [node.js installed](https://nodejs.org/en). Clone down this repo. Open it up in your favorite IDE. In the terminal `cd` into the project you would like to run. Make sure you are in the projects folder. Then run the two commands below to install all the projects dependency and then start it up.

```bash
npm install
npx expo start
```

## Updating this repo

If you find a mistake or find something out of date feel free to update it. Just do a fork and then a PR. Make sure not to push up `node_modules` or any other `.git` folders (by default expo makes the project a git repo).
