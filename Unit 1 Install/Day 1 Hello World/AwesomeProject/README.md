## Expo Install

### Node.js

#### Linux

-   Install NPM (sometimes called npx) you probably already have this but if you don't run `sudo apt install npm`
-   Your all done ðŸ¥³

#### Windows

This is a more complicated on Windows.

-   Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
-   Make sure you **check the box** that includes "necessary tool" like Chocolaty
-   This will take a long time (up to 30m ðŸ˜¥) and open many console windows make to press `Enter` when it asks you to
-   Reboot your PC
-   If you are still getting errors go into `AppData>Roaming` and make `npm` folder if it doesn't exist

### Expo Go

### Android Emulator

### Web

Try to run your app on web as well with the following. If this command is out of date just try to run via web on main expo menu and it will give you up to date one.

```
npx expo install react-native-web@~0.19.6 react-dom@18.2.0 @expo/webpack-config@^19.0.0
```
